MOLE INFESTATION


You lived in a peaceful village...***until the moles came***! The villagers' farms were being destroyed and as a result, your village is suffering from starvation.
You find out that there are holes that are entrances to the mole caves. You devise a plan to destroy the moles. Shoot into the black holes using your cannon, but 
remember, you only have 20 cannonballs. Use the down arrow key to shoot. Use the left and right arrrow keys to tilt the cannon.
